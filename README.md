Machine Learning Open Source Software
=====================================
Notebooks / material for the machine learning software practical.

This tutorial covers some of the tools provided by scikit-learn, as well as an
introduction to pystruct.

You need scikit-learn v0.15 and ipython v3.0 for this practical.
If you don't already have an installation, I recommend using the anaconda distribution:
http://continuum.io/downloads

For the last part, you will also need pystruct, which you can install using

    pip install pystruct

If it errors on installing PyQPBO or AD3, don't worry too much.

Check out the documentation of scikit-learn at http://scikit-learn.org/dev/documentation
and pystruct at http://pystruct.github.io
